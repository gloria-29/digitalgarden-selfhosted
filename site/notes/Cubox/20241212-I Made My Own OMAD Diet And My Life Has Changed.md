他们告诉你腹肌是在厨房里练就的，这话一点也不假。

Yes, what you are about to read is a story of a woman going on what felt like a diet but has now been identified as a lifestyle. Women and dieting go together like fish goes with chips, or yolk goes with eggs. Everyone knows this by now.  
是的，你将要读到的是一个女人节食的故事，但现在已经被确定为一种生活方式。女人和节食就像鱼和薯条、蛋黄和鸡蛋。现在大家都知道这一点了。

What I'm about to tell you at first felt like a diet. I would tell my friends I'm dieting and I would avoid seriously unhealthy food\*. That was back in April, and now we are in November, upon reflection it seems I've unconsciously adopted a diet that I had read about before but completely disregarded.  
我接下来要告诉你的事情，一开始让我感觉像是在节食。我会告诉我的朋友我在节食，我会避免吃严重不健康的食物\*。那是四月份的事了，现在我们已经到了十一月份，仔细想想，我似乎在不知不觉中采用了一种我以前读到过但完全忽视的节食方法。

*\*I never avoid processed food, just seriously unhealthy food.*   
\*我从不回避加工食品，只回避严重不健康的食品。

After moving out from university two years ago, my ideal weight had turned to a non-ideal weight gain. Life escalated and the non-ideal weight turned into an even more non-ideal weight.  
两年前从大学搬出来后，我的理想体重变成了非理想体重。随着生活节奏的加快，非理想体重变成了更加非理想的体重。

Staying slim for me has never been easy, it's not easy for most people. However, I've never seen the societal definition of "fat." My average size comes in a UK size 12, but I'm very aware of my ideal weight so it was just a case of getting it back down and finding the time to do it.  
保持苗条对我来说从来都不容易，对大多数人来说也不容易。然而，我从未见过社会对 "胖 "的定义。我的平均体型是英国的 12 号，但我非常清楚自己的理想体重，所以只需要把体重降下来，并找到时间去做。

First, I started doing more cardio so it was back to the treadmill in the gym. Cardio has always worked for me, so it's going to work again. Right?  
首先，我开始做更多的有氧运动，所以又回到了健身房的跑步机上。有氧运动对我一直很有效，所以它还会继续起作用。对吧？

Wrong! I'm not 19 anymore and my metabolism has clearly slowed down. It was time to resort to another plan.  
错了我已经不是 19 岁了，新陈代谢明显减慢。是时候采用另一种计划了。

It's no secret that one of the keys to losing weight is to eat more vegetables, fruit, and [heavy protein meals](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-much-protein-to-build-muscle#:~:text=Based%20on%20averages%20from%20evidence,re%20a%20woman%20in%20midlife.). So, it was time to keep up with the cardio and eat more vegetables, fruit, and protein.  
多吃蔬菜、水果和高蛋白膳食是减肥的关键之一，这已经不是什么秘密了。因此，是时候坚持有氧运动，多吃蔬菜、水果和蛋白质了。

After a short trip to the shop, I returned to my flat with bananas, strawberries, and blueberries. The aim was to create a protein powder smoothie but the fruit does not provide enough protein, so I placed an order online for some French vanilla protein powder.  
去商店买了一会儿水果后，我带着香蕉、草莓和蓝莓回到公寓。我的目的是制作蛋白粉冰沙，但水果不能提供足够的蛋白质，因此我在网上订购了一些法国香草蛋白粉。

I can confirm the smoothie was delicious (as I expected) and provided me with 30g of protein in a meal. They don't lie when they say protein fills you up. That's even more than the average protein bar.  
我可以肯定，这款冰沙非常美味（正如我所料），而且在一餐中为我提供了 30 克蛋白质。他们说蛋白质能让人饱腹，这话一点也不假。这比一般的蛋白棒还要多。

Okay, so my plan worked but now I need to incorporate it into my day-to-day. Introducing, the OMAD diet.  
好了，我的计划成功了，但现在我需要把它融入我的日常生活中。介绍一下，OMAD 饮食法。
> OMAD = One Meal A Day
>
> OMAD = 每日一餐

For breakfast, a bowl of cereal of my choice. It doesn't matter if it's chocolate cereal or not [despite the claims that it's massively unhealthy](https://www.delightedcooking.com/what-is-chocolate-cereal.htm) for you. If I stick to the average 30g --- 50g bowl, I'm sure I'm not doing too much damage.  
早餐，一碗我喜欢的麦片粥。不管是不是巧克力麦片，尽管有人说巧克力麦片对人体非常不健康。如果我坚持吃一碗 30 克到 50 克的普通麦片，我相信不会对身体造成太大伤害。

For lunch, a meal of my choice. If I'm in the office, the chances are it will be pasta, a tuna sandwich, or chicken caesar salad. If I'm working from home, the chances are it will be fish fingers or chicken burgers, waffles, and a side of vegetables. If I'm out, then I won't eat until I get home (unless I'm out all day).  
午餐，我自选一餐。如果我在办公室，可能是意大利面、金枪鱼三明治或凯撒鸡肉沙拉。如果我在家工作，可能是鱼排或鸡肉汉堡、华夫饼和配菜。如果我出门在外，那么在回家之前我不会吃东西（除非我一整天都在外面）。

For dinner, a protein fruit smoothie --- ideally after my workout as the [optimal time to have protein](https://www.eatright.org/fitness/physical-activity/exercise-nutrition/timing-your-pre-and-post-workout-nutrition#:~:text=Protein%20is%20there%20to%20help,works%20best%20for%20your%20body.) after working out is 60 minutes.  
晚餐是蛋白质水果冰沙--最好是在运动后，因为运动后摄入蛋白质的最佳时间是 60 分钟。

So, the one meal is lunch. Cereal is not a meal, please don't fool yourself.  
所以，一顿饭就是午餐。麦片不是正餐，请不要自欺欺人。

The [original OMAD diet](https://www.health.com/weight-loss/omad-diet#:~:text=OMAD%20stands%20for%20One%20Meal,disease%20and%20other%20health%20issues.) is a form of intermittent fasting that involves eating whatever you want but only one meal in a one-hour window per day. Yeah, no thanks.  
最初的 OMAD 饮食是一种间歇性断食法，即想吃什么就吃什么，但每天只能在一小时内吃一顿饭。是的，不，谢谢。

I've been doing this since April and can say my life has improved in the following ways:  
我从四月份开始这样做，可以说我的生活在以下方面得到了改善：

1. Fuller for longer.  
   饱满更持久
2. Feeling healthy on the inside.  
   内心感到健康
3. Not feeling full and heavy in my stomach.  
   胃里没有饱胀感和沉重感
4. More energy.  
   更多能量
5. Understand my body better.  
   更好地了解自己的身体

And most importantly, I've broken an unhealthy obsession with large portions of meals.  
最重要的是，我打破了对大份量饭菜的不健康迷恋。

To conclude, it's not a lie when they tell you that abs are made in the kitchen, but the key ingredients are discipline and movement. I've been trying to get to this state of happiness for years. I've been combating my cravings for sweets on a daily basis for years.  
总之，"腹肌是在厨房里练出来的 "这句话一点也不假，但关键在于纪律和运动。多年来，我一直在努力达到这种幸福的状态。多年来，我每天都在与对甜食的渴望作斗争。

When I think about it, it's a blessing that I'm mid-size and not plus-size.  
仔细想想，我是中等身材，而不是超大身材，这是我的福气。

I can confirm I've not got abs yet, but I've been focusing on overall health and eating habits instead of shaping my waist and stomach.  
我可以肯定，我还没有腹肌，但我一直在关注整体健康和饮食习惯，而不是塑造腰腹。
