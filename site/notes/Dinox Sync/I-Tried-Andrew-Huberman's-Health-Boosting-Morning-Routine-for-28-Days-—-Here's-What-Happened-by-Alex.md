**I felt stuck.**

My days started to look frustratingly similar. Every day, I&#39;d sleep less than desired yet wake later than planned — only to spend countless minutes on my phone. Then I&#39;d write less than usual and have a less-than-ideal attitude at work.

I felt like I was constantly behind.

And for someone who loves feeling in control (not good either, I know), feeling like I was failing myself was lethal. I was disappointed and desperate. I needed a change, something to get me back on track.

Enter [Andrew Huberman](https://www.hubermanlab.com/).

He&#39;s a neuroscientist and Neurobiology professor at Stanford School of Medicine. Most importantly, he&#39;s the host of the world-famous [Huberman Lab](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast) podcast, where he features a wide variety of health experts and also shares useful, science-backed tools for regular Janes like me.

One of such tools is the Daily Blueprint Huberman allows you to download for free from the official [webpage](https://www.hubermanlab.com/daily-blueprint). It contains science-backed habits that can — according to Huberman — help us sleep better, boost our productivity, and improve our overall health.

I was immediately sold.

Science-backed habits that I can introduce into my life through an exciting challenge?

_Sign me up._

**That said, I decided to only focus on improving my mornings as I&#39;ve learned in the past that trying to incorporate too many habits into your routine is a recipe for failure.** It&#39;s best to start small.

For this, I followed the guide I downloaded from Huberman&#39;s website and watched the interviews where Huberman shared his morning routine, like the one below:

Once I knew what I needed to do, it was time to start my experiment.

From July 11th to August 8th, I tried Andrew Huberman&#39;s health-boosting morning routine, an experience I&#39;ll share here, covering:

*   The challenge itself, including the habits in detail and the key insights I learned.
*   The results: Did my sleep improve? Am I waking up earlier? Do I feel more productive? Do I feel healthier?
*   Whether it was worth it.

Here&#39;s what happened:

&gt; **Disclaimer:** The purpose of this article is to share my experience with Andrew Huberman&#39;s morning routine — not to provide medical advice. So remember to consult a healthcare professional before adding new habits to your routine.

### PART I: Adopting a Science-Based Morning Routine

Andrew Huberman&#39;s morning routine consists of the following habits:

*   **Early wake time.** He usually wakes up between 6–6:30 AM. However, this isn&#39;t a strict rule as he doesn&#39;t encourage you to have a specific wake time in his guide. That said, as I&#39;m someone who loves to make the most of my mornings, I decided to shoot for an earlier wake time as part of this challenge. **Note:** Huberman doesn&#39;t check his phone as soon as he wakes up (the hardest part for me).
*   **Deliberate cold exposure.** Huberman [likes to do](https://x.com/hubermanlab/status/1610028027907543042?lang&#61;en) a 3-minute cold plunge or shower immediately after waking up. He [says](https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/the-science-and-use-of-cold-exposure-for-health-and-performance) this helps him increase energy and focus, build resilience, enhance mood, and increase metabolism. As for how cold it should be, he says this is something personal. It should feel uncomfortable yet safe. **Note:** In the [video above](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kAOuzkI9LsI), Huberman says he does cold exposure last, yet this [recent tweet](https://x.com/hubermanlab/status/1610028027907543042?lang&#61;en) claims he does it first thing in the morning (why I&#39;ve placed it as the second habit).
*   **Light exposure.** Huberman goes out for a short 10- to 15-minute walk to get sun exposure. This [helps him](https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/43X8TsN1) feel energized, regulate his metabolism, improve his mood, and sleep better. **Note**: If it&#39;s a sunny day, shoot for 5–10 minutes, and if it&#39;s cloudy, 10–15. Also, remember not to stare directly at the sun as it can harm your eyes.
*   **Salty water.** Huberman likes to hydrate with plenty of water (around 32 ounces or a liter) and a pinch of sea salt [to improve alertness and stabilize blood sugar](https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/CVGFJFgu). He&#39;ll often also take electrolytes or a greens supplement.
*   **90-minute work block.** After his walk, Huberman prioritizes challenging work like reading a research paper or preparing a podcast. He keeps his phone off to avoid distractions. And though the length seems short, Huberman [assures](https://dexa.ai/s/WDLmNnto?source&#61;legacy_app) us we can get a lot done in 90 minutes as our ability to focus ebbs and flows throughout the day in cycles of around this length. **Note:** He recommends we use [binaural beats of 40hz frequency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;1_G60OdEzXs) and keeping our screens at eye level or above to increase alertness.
*   **Delayed caffeine.** Huberman waits 90 to 120 minutes before drinking any caffeinated drink, [which helps him](https://ai.hubermanlab.com/s/Ck9vyXBd) feel more energized throughout the day. It also helps him avoid the typical after-lunch slump. **Note:** According to Huberman, it&#39;s fine to drink caffeine straightaway if you exercise immediately after waking up.
*   **Fasted workout.** After his morning work block, Huberman exercises for an hour on average. He alternates between resistance training and cardio (more on this later).
*   **Breakfast.** Huberman will usually break his fast between 11 AM to 12 PM. He usually [has](https://www.gq.com/story/real-life-diet-andrew-huberman) some oatmeal with fruits and a protein shake if he resistance trained, followed by a large low-carb, high-protein meal like steak and veggies. When he doesn&#39;t resistance train, he goes straight to the low-carb, high-protein meal. **Note**: As for the rest of the day, Huberman will sometimes snack on nuts or a protein shake, and he&#39;ll have a high-carb and protein dinner (like a pasta) because he claims it helps him sleep better.

If seeing all these habits listed out feels intimidating, you&#39;re not alone. That&#39;s why I created a visual schedule that helped me track what I (ideally) needed to do every morning.

![Image 1: Ideal Huberman-based morning routine. What happens when you follow Andrew Huberman’s science-based morning routine for a month](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*4acjo5lWsVLUPrRLRTtXyw.png)

Ideal Huberman-based morning routine. Note 1: I added skin care because it&#39;s a vital part of my routine. Note 2: I gave myself an hour to shower because my hair is very long — not to mention that it&#39;s always a good practice to give yourself plenty of room for mistakes. [Image by author]

**The first thing you&#39;ll likely notice when seeing this schedule is that it&#39;s unrealistic for most people.**

The only reason I was even able to attempt this challenge was because I work remotely and because I start at noon. However, if you start at 9 AM yet still want to give this a shot, I&#39;d suggest the following schedule:

![Image 2: Alternative schedule for people working a regular 9–5. What happens when you follow Andrew Huberman’s science-based morning routine for a month](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*CN2KJ2dRyqL2UfAxzVI9fg.png)

Alternative schedule for people working a regular 9–5. Note 1: The workout can be longer if you work from home or if it takes you very little time to shower. Note 2: You could wake up an hour sooner to lengthen the workout. Note 3: Breakfast should be prepared the day before and taken to work. [Image by author]

The schedule above is a bit more realistic — but only if you don&#39;t have children.

If you&#39;re a parent… Huberman&#39;s full morning routine might not be for you, but perhaps some of the habits might still be useful.

Anyway… Now that I knew what my new morning routine was supposed to look like, I went full Huberman mode for 4 weeks.

&gt; **Note:** If you want more detail into why Huberman does all of these habits, here&#39;s a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;31DMZLK_PPs&amp;t&#61;8217s) in which he explains it in detail.

#### Week 1

The first week was challenging for three main reasons: the early wake-up time, the deliberate cold exposure, and the fasted workout.

Before this challenge, I&#39;d been going to sleep at midnight and waking up at 8 AM, so waking two hours earlier than usual was _hard_ — especially considering that Huberman doesn&#39;t need an alarm.

And so… I tried to get myself to _naturally_ wake earlier.

How?

Simple. I forced myself to get up at 6-_ish_ on day 2 (even if I was a zombie that day), which helped me fall asleep earlier that night and _naturally_ wake up earlier on day 3.

![Image 3: Left (Wake up time day 1). Center (Wake up time day 2 — using an alarm). Right (Wake up time day 3). What happens when you follow Andrew Huberman’s science-based morning routine for a month](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*gV3NeXATXvuU2qiVNLJ_RA.png)

Left (Wake up time day 1). Center (Wake up time day 2 — using an alarm with a couple of snoozes). Right (Wake up time day 3). [Images by author]

My plan worked. From then on, I started to have a more Huberman-esque wake-up time.

**But then came the cold exposure.**

_Ugh._

Having a cold shower after peeling myself off of my warm, cozy bed was… There are no words powerful enough to describe the hell it was.

Yes, I felt more alert after the 3 minutes were done. Yes, I knew it was good for me and yada yada — but I still dreaded this moment with every fiber of my being. It made me not want to wake up.

And you know what?

I hadn&#39;t started this challenge to feel miserable. And so on day 4, I was a friend to myself and changed what &quot;cold exposure&quot; would mean for me from that point forward.

That day, instead of a cold shower, I simply wore shorts on my morning walk. As I was staying in the Spanish Pyrenees, the temperature that early was usually around 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 16 degrees Celsius).

You can bet my legs complained before they got used to the morning chill.

![Image 4](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*gqJ9Kkaa9AdTJhmggNeOwA@2x.jpeg)

![Image 5: None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*egOIATg2bWfeXjYTF1BaBQ@2x.jpeg)

The next parts of Huberman&#39;s morning routine were easy to follow.

I was already used to drinking at least two large glasses of water when I woke up, so I just continued with my camel ways and had a pinch of salt on the side (salty water just wasn&#39;t my thing). Though I was skeptical at first, I definitely noticed that the salt helped curb my appetite.

Then I wrote for 90 minutes as I&#39;d been doing on and off for years, which was one of the main benefits I got from this challenge: returning to my old writing routine. Not to mention I felt super focused after my morning walk.

As for the caffeine…

Well, delaying my morning green tea was a struggle, but as I was walking outside instead, I barely noticed.

I simply brewed it before my writing session and started drinking it halfway through (I don&#39;t like mine hot anyway).

**But then came the fasted workout.**

_Damn._

I just didn&#39;t have the energy. I was too tired and hungry to do anything properly. The only exercises I managed to complete were short jumping rope sessions (I was doing a [600-jump challenge](https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/i-did-600-jump-ropes-a-day-for-30-days-heres-what-happened-1f1e687e9c90?source&#61;stats_homepage-------------------------------------) in parallel), my [morning stretching routine](https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/i-performed-daily-yoga-asanas-for-365-days-the-results-blew-me-away-a79ed49f8912), and the sunlight-viewing walk.

But an hour of resistance training or cardio?

Impossible.

I just couldn&#39;t.

And funnily enough, I learned why during a [Huberman Lab podcast with Dr. Stacy Sims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;pZX8ikmWvEU), where she explains that women shouldn&#39;t do fasted exercise due to our unique physiology. That&#39;s why she recommends we consume some protein and carbs because otherwise our performance and results suffer.

This podcast episode made me feel seen and validated.

Most importantly, it reminded me that **even if something is science-based or popular, we must still test everything ourselves and only keep what works for us.**

In my case, I stopped trying to work out fasted. Instead, I had breakfast as soon as I finished writing and then worked out, which made me feel great and encouraged me to experiment further on week 2.

&gt; **Note:** I didn&#39;t do everything according to the set schedule every day. On day 6, for instance, my husband and I went on a morning trek so _of course_ we had breakfast earlier, and _of course_ I didn&#39;t write.

&gt; So yeah…. This is just a reminder that life is life and that morning routines are great to give us structure on most days, but we shouldn&#39;t feel restricted by them.

![Image 6: Morning trek on day 6. What happens when you follow Andrew Huberman’s science-based morning routine for a month](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*hiO6OMaKSAgye6JXpdgxIw@2x.jpeg)

#### Week 2

In the second week, I started to enjoy the routine a lot more.

Now that I&#39;d figured out the major things that were or weren&#39;t working for me — no cold shower, no fasted workout, a pinch of salt on the side— I let myself have fun.

The morning walks were the best. The sound of birds, the crunch of gravel, the amazing Pyrenee views.

Wow, just wow.

I fell completely in love with this habit. Though [I&#39;ve been walking 20k steps per day for months](https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/i-walked-20k-steps-per-day-for-6-months-heres-what-happened-9da7a92d2523?source&#61;stats_homepage-------------------------------------), I&#39;d usually done my morning steps in my living room or on my [treadmill desk](https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/ive-used-a-treadmill-desk-for-6-months-here-s-everything-i-ve-seen-and-learned-60a32b348700?source&#61;stats_homepage-------------------------------------), but I will continue going outside (unless there&#39;s bad weather) from now on.

![Image 7: None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*UfxxGGs2-qZXz3ZoaNAq-g@2x.jpeg)

![Image 8: None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*81sEAtGowHTQwy87M1YWCg@2x.jpeg)

Week 2, however, also had its fair share of experimentation.

One day, my sister accompanied me on my morning walk, and we immersed our feet in a stream (a new form of cold exposure). Another day I didn&#39;t go out for a morning walk and instead decided to have an early breakfast — I was too hungry — while basking in the morning sunlight.

I even got a new green tea blend with [yerba mate](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/yerba-mate/faq-20058343#:~:text&#61;A%20daily%20cup%20of%20tea,called%20inflammation%20and%20cancer%20risk.), Huberman&#39;s preferred caffeine source as it provides steady energy throughout the day while having antioxidant properties.

It was yum.

I also allowed myself to vary the time I spent on each activity.

Sometimes my morning walks were longer. Sometimes I wrote for longer than 90 minutes.

**I simply let myself have fun, which is a major tip when incorporating new habits.**

&gt; **Note:** Though I had a blast this week and felt like everything went smoothly, I still didn&#39;t adhere to the routine 100% on some days, and I still struggled with some parts of it.

&gt; My biggest hurdle, for example, was not checking my phone as soon as I woke up. And though I wish I could tell you I&#39;ve overcome this bad habit thanks to this amazing morning routine, I&#39;d be lying.

&gt; As I said before, adding or eliminating habits takes time and it&#39;s best not too do too many at once.

#### Week 3

The third week had even more experimentation.

As I felt like I had Huberman&#39;s morning routine under control, I decided to explore some of his other daily habits.

On day 23, I got an awful afternoon slump, so I gave [non-sleep deep rest (NSDR)](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/meditation-for-sleep/what-is-non-sleep-deep-rest) a shot. This is a short meditation-like activity that helps you feel deeply relaxed without falling asleep. It usually involves you focusing on your breath first and then shifting your focus to different parts of your body.

Below you&#39;ll find a guided video, voiced by Huberman himself:

The experience was as Huberman promised: deeply relaxing.

If I wasn&#39;t someone who struggles with napping, I would&#39;ve likely fallen asleep. Still, I _did_ feel replenished, so I&#39;ll definitely keep this tool in hand for those days when I need an afternoon brain reset.

**And this isn&#39;t the only non-morning Huberman habit I decided to try and keep.**

Having a carby dinner worked well for my sleep, as did going out for a sunset walk. It turns out that the [low solar angle](https://www.hubermanlab.com/newsletter/using-light-for-health) at this time of day signals to our brain that it&#39;s time to start unwinding.

And to be honest… Even if the sunset walks didn&#39;t have a positive impact on sleep, I still would want to keep them as a regular habit.

They&#39;re just _so_ nice.

#### Week 4

In the challenge&#39;s final week, I tried Huberman&#39;s fitness protocol.

I downloaded it for free from his [webpage](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64416928859cbdd1716d79ce/650e450994ef9ab775e16acf_Neural_Network_Newsletter_Foundational_Fitness_Protocol.pdf) and gave it a shot (after breakfast of course).

Here&#39;s what the routine looked like:

![Image 9: Summary of Huberman’s fitness protocol. What happens when you follow Andrew Huberman’s science-based morning routine for a month](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*jc1vgrL4_LfeKQOMZFeJyA.png)

[Image by author]

For the long endurance session, my husband and I went on a long hike. For the 35-minute cardio session, we went on a bike ride. And for the HIIT session, I jumped rope (as I mentioned before, I was doing a [600-jump rope challenge](https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/i-did-600-jump-ropes-a-day-for-30-days-heres-what-happened-1f1e687e9c90?source&#61;your_stories_page-------------------------------------) simultaneously).

I loved every minute of the cardio workouts, and since improving my cardio fitness has been one of my goals this year, trying these different intensity and length workouts was a great experiment.

**In the case of the resistance training workouts,** I did the following exercises on the leg day:

*   A **warmup** that consisted of jumping rope.
*   **Quadriceps:** 3 sets of 12 [Leg extensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;MpEydcQ1oDw) + 3 sets of 12 [leg presses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;p5dCqF7wWUw) (90-second rest between each set).
*   **Hamstrings:** 3 sets of 12 [Leg curls](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ANKSmhT0dTk) + 3 sets of 12 [barbell deadlifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;AweC3UaM14o) (90-second rest between each set).
*   **Calves:** 3 sets of 12 [standing calf raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;g_E7_q1z2bo) (90-second rest between each set).

These are the ones I did on the torso and neck day:

*   A **warmup** that consisted of jumping rope.
*   **Chest:** 3 sets of 12 [flat dumbbell bench presses](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SidmT09GXz8) + 3 sets of 12 [push-ups](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ba8tr1NzwXU) (90-second rest between each set).
*   **Back:** 3 sets of 12 [wide grip lat pulldowns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;7JnP8dFbS14) + 3 sets of 12 [dumbbell bent over rows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;6gvmcqr226U) (90-second rest between each set).
*   **Shoulder:** a superset of 3 sets of 12 [lateral dumbbell raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;XPPfnSEATJA) and 12 [front dumbbell raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;hRJ6tR5-if0) (90-second rest between each superset).
*   **Neck:** I followed the instructions in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;wjiZaCJ6tCA) (Huberman recommended it).

And these are the ones I did on the arms, neck, and calves day:

*   A **warmup** that consisted of jumping rope.
*   **Arms:** 3 sets of 12 [bicep curls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;HnHuhf4hEWY) + 3 sets of 12 [skull crushers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;1BDGIcMTSXc) (90-second rest between each set).
*   **Neck:** I followed the instructions in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;wjiZaCJ6tCA) (Huberman recommended it).
*   **Calves:** 3 sets of 12 [standing calf raises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#61;g_E7_q1z2bo) (90-second rest between each set).

All in all, this resistance training routine didn&#39;t work for me.

It didn&#39;t focus on my favorite muscle group (the glutes), and it was too upper-body focused for my taste (I don&#39;t like training my neck).

Moreover, I&#39;m not a fan of doing split training because I sometimes miss workouts because I&#39;m too tired, I have too much work, or because life simply happened. That&#39;s why I prefer to always do full-body workouts. If I miss out on one day, I can still work my entire body on another day (You can check my current routine [here](https://medium.com/in-fitness-and-in-health/i-took-creatine-for-28-days-even-though-i-was-terrified-of-gaining-weight-heres-what-happened-576e0b818c64)).

**As for the heat and cold exposure sessions Huberman does on day 3 of his protocol**… Well, as I was in the Spanish Pyrenees, I didn&#39;t have access to a sauna and ice bath.

I had to get creative.

That&#39;s why that day I went to a nearby pool (super cold because it&#39;s not heated and temperatures plummet during nighttime) and alternated between 30 minutes of sunbathing (heat exposure) and 10 minutes in the pool (cold exposure).

It was an amazing experience.

![Image 10: None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*DvV--f72lMzPYKVocmKEow@2x.jpeg)

![Image 11: None](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*aQt9ywwn-6m8P9i2QHeB_g@2x.jpeg)

And with this, my 28-day Huberman-based morning routine experiment ended. Now it was time to reflect on my results.

### PART II: The Results

The three main goals I had with this challenge were to improve my sleep, to be more consistent with my writing, and to feel healthier overall.

And Huberman&#39;s morning routine delivered.

Not only did I feel like my sleep was more consistent and I felt more rested, but I was also able to establish a new natural wake time for me.

Since I finished the challenge, I&#39;ve still been waking up as early as I wanted.

![Image 12: Left (wake up time on challenge’s final day). Center (Wake up time 5 days after challenge ended). Right (Wake up time nearly two weeks after the challenge ended).

Left (wake up time on challenge&#39;s final day). Center (Wake up time 5 days after challenge ended). Right (Wake up time nearly two weeks after the challenge ended). [Images by author]

This early wake time, in turn, has helped me be more consistent with my writing routine, as I rarely have any interruptions at that hour.

Moreover, waking up earlier has made it so that I&#39;m naturally going to sleep earlier, creating a virtuous cycle that has overall made me feel healthier (my third goal). Not to mention that the morning and sunset walks have been huge mood boosters.

In other words, this experiment has been a huge success for me.

Yes, I had to make some modifications to the habits, and yes, some habits still elude me (not checking my phone as soon as I wake up). But overall I&#39;m sleeping better, I&#39;m writing more, and I feel healthier and happier.

### PART III: Would I Recommend Huberman&#39;s Morning Routine?

Andrew&#39;s morning protocol is full of science-based practices that no doubt can help you feel more rested, more productive, and healthier.

That said, it&#39;s unrealistic for most people (unless you&#39;re a childless professor, influencer, or someone who works the afternoon shift). Moreover, if you&#39;re a female like me, then it might not suit your physiology or fitness goals.

However, I still think trying Huberman&#39;s daily habits is worthwhile.

Trying is the only way to know what works and what doesn&#39;t for you. And if you&#39;re inspired to do your own experiment after reading mine, here are some best practices that might help you along the way:

*   Don&#39;t try all habits at once. It&#39;s better for you to start with a few, and when you feel you have the hang of them, incorporate more.
*   Create a visual schedule of the new morning routine you wish to try, and remember to give yourself extra time for each activity as life happens.
*   If something doesn&#39;t feel right, change it or quit it.
*   If something isn&#39;t enjoyable, change it or quit it.

The whole point of self-improvement is to improve our lives, so if you try something that takes away instead of adding, then simply move on to the next thing.

After all, we are the experts in ourselves.
